// `composer.tsx` wires a lot of imperative, timing-sensitive glue (file
// pickers, editor sessions, refs) that isn't practical to mount and drive in
// isolation — see segment-media-target.test.ts for the same source-assertion
// approach. No test in this repo mounts composer.tsx itself: it pulls in
// live Inertia `useHttp`/`usePage`, autosave-to-server, media upload, and
// image/video editor hooks that would all need mocking, unlike the small
// presentational components (ComposerToolbar, SegmentMediaRow) that already
// have real render tests in this directory. These pin the fix for a bug
// where dropping a video into one thread segment was rejected as "mixed
// video and images" because an image already lived in a *different*
// segment: the guard checked `state.media` (the whole post's flat media
// across every segment) instead of only the media already attached to the
// segment the drop targets.
//
// `wouldMixVideoAndImages`/`wouldViolateBlueskyGif` themselves are pure and
// already have real behavioral coverage in
// `resources/js/lib/compose/__tests__/media-rules.test.ts`; this file's only
// job is pinning what composer.tsx passes as their `existing` argument at
// the call site, which is composer-internal wiring with no pure-function
// home to move to.
